# ADRC — prebuilt hex of upstream PR betaflight/betaflight#15400

⚠️ **Experimental. Bench-test before flying. Use at your own risk.**

These are ready-to-flash builds of the **upstream ADRC pull request**
[betaflight/betaflight#15400](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/15400)
(opt-in `pid_type = ADRC` per PID profile, classic PID untouched by default), so you
don't have to wait on the Configurator cloud build — or fight it when it queues or
errors out. The exact source commit is in the release tag description; the same code
can also be cloud-built by entering `#15400` in the Configurator's *Select commit*
field (visible only when the `2026.6.0-alpha` version is selected in the dropdown).

## Which file do I flash?

Same convention as official Betaflight releases:

- **Your board has its own hex** (`betaflight_2026.6.0-alpha_<BOARDNAME>.hex`) — use it.
- **Board not listed?** Use the **generic hex for your MCU** (`STM32F7X2` for any F722,
  `STM32F405`, `STM32H743`, `AT32F435M/G`, …) and accept *Apply custom defaults* on
  first connect.

Flash via Configurator → Firmware Flasher → **Load Firmware [Local]**.

## Enabling ADRC

ADRC is **off by default** — the firmware flies classic PID until you opt in:

```
set pid_type = ADRC
save
```

Starting tunables (flight-validated on two 5" and a 65 mm whoop; see the
[tuning guide](https://github.com/danusha2345/ADRC-betaflight#tuning)):
`adrc_wc_* = 60`, `adrc_wo_* = 100` (yaw 80), `adrc_b0_* = 2000` (5") — whoops need
roughly `33/65/3200`. Set `debug_mode = ADRC` and enable blackbox if you can — logs
are the most valuable thing you can send.
